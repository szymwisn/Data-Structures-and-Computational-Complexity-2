## Data Structures and Computational Complexity Project 2



Project consists of implementation of different graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim), algorithms to find the quickest path from a node to the others (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) and analysis of their computational complexity. All the coding is done in C++ using STL in CLion.
